That's it, the link between your Jeedom and Google Home / Assistant is done.

You can now talk to your Jeedom and use all the interactions of your Jeedom directly from your Google Home / Assistant.
From your Google Home / Assistant, just say "Speak to Jeedom", "Ask Jeedom" or "Tell Jeedom" to start the interaction with Jeedom and "Thank you" when you're done to close the conversation.
